# spring-gumball ci/cd example
Just a repository to test CI/CD for my CMPE 172 lab. All code is authored by Professor Paul Nguyen. All documentation of process can be found in the README.md in my lab repository under Lab10.

## Submission
We were asked to submit a link to our personal "public" GitHub Repo for Lab #10, which is this.
I have also linked my class lab repository <a href='https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe172-justin-zhu1018'>here</a> and the lab10 folder <a href='https://github.com/nguyensjsu/cmpe172-justin-zhu1018/tree/main/labs/lab10'>here</a> for ease of access to my README.md. Note that it is a private repository, since it is for the class only.
